Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming? software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems.
software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications(the software development life cycle). it differs from traditional programming in that traditional programming focuses on the coding aspect.



Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. software development life cycle phases
requirements- the user needs(the problem)and the system requirements(what needed to design the solution)
design- creating designs of the software architecture and user interface
implementation- writing code(a line of instruction)and building a software according to design specifications
testing- to ensure the software meets quality standards( is it doing what it is expected to do)and functional requirements(is it doing it the right way)
deployment- releasing the software to users
maintenance- after software deployment, providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software.



Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases. it is a step by step process(e.g. requirements then design then implementation). it is preferred for short term projects.
agile methodology is an incremental type and is preferred because it is flexible, adapts to change. it can therefore be used for long term projects.



Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles: Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and managing the requirements for a software system.
the process of requirement engineering 
     requirement elicitation and gathering- involves understanding the needs of stakeholders.
     requirement analysis- the gathered needs are analyzed and potential conflicts are identified and resolved.
     requirement specification- clear and concise documents are created that detail the functional and non functional requirements of a software. the documents serve as   
  a blueprint for developers.
     requirement verification and validation- ensures that the documented requirements reflect the stakeholders needs and that the system is built to meet those requirements

importance in SDLC

reduces misunderstandings
improves project scope management
increases development efficiency
reduces risk of errors
provides a baseline for testing
facilitates communication




Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Modularity in software design is the process of decomposing a complex software into smaller, self contained units called modules which are designed to perform specific, well defined tasks and interact with each other through well defined interfaces.
How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems.
maintainability in software engineering refers to the ease to which a software system can be modified, understood, and enhanced over its lifecycle. In a modular system, changes are isolated within modules, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of unintended consequences.
scalability in software engineering refers to a systems ability to handle increasing demands or workloads. New modules can be created to address new requirements without affecting the existing functionalities.



Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? unit testing- individual units of code are tested in isolation to verify they work as intended.
integration testing- focuses on testing how different units of code work together after they are integrated into larger components.
system testing- evaluates the whole system as a whole to ensure it meets the functional and non functional requirements.
acceptance testing- done by end users to validate if it meets their needs and business requirements. Ensures the system is usable and delivers value to the stakeholders.

why is testing crucial 

testing plays a vital role in ensuring the quality and success of software development projects. There is early bug detection, improved software quality, enhanced user experience and increased confidence.



Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Version control systems are essential tools in software development for managing changes to code and other project files. Version control systems ensure a clear history of code changes, streamline collaboration and provide a safety net for experimentation and potential errors.
Examples of version control systems; Git, Git hub



Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? A software project manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.
Responsibilities; project planning-the project manager creates a roadmap that guides the entire development projects
                ;team management-motivates team members, assigns tasks, facilitates communication, and ensures everyone is aligned on project objectives
                ;budget management- estimates development costs, tracks expenses, and identifies areas of optimization to ensure financial viability
                ;quality assurance- maintaining high software quality throughout the development lifecycle is crucial.
Challenges; communication gaps
          ; resource constraints
          ;technological advancements
          ;meeting deadlines



Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? Software maintenance is the ongoing process of modifying, updating, and enhancing a software system after its initial development and deployment.
Types of maintenance activities
1. corrective maintenance-it addresses issues that arise after deployment, focuses on fixing bugs, errors, and defects in the software that prevent it from functioning as intended.
2. adaptive maintenance- involves modifying the software to adapt to changes in the environment such as new hardware, operating systems, regulations, or business requirements. Ensures the software remains compatible and functional amidst external changes.
3. perfective maintenance- aims to enhance the software's functionality, usability, performance, or security.
4. preventive maintenance- involves making changes to the software's code or structure to prevent future problems.

Importance of maintenance- ensures functionality and reliability
                 - adapts to change
                 -improves performance and security
                 -extends software lifespan
                 -reduces cost



Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Ethical issues encountered by software engineers; privacy concerns, alogarithmic bias, security vulnerabilities, dark patterns, automation and job displacement.

How to ensure they adhere to ethical standards; stay informed, questions and discuss, focus on user well being, advocate for transparency and report unethical practices.
